## Why I Built This

I’ve been a fan of note-taking with **Notion** since the day it launched—I even paid for the subscription. But one day, I decided to cut down on my recurring expenses, and Notion was one of the first to go. That’s when I realized: getting out wasn’t easy.

I tried **Obsidian**. It looked great at first, but over time I found it too distracting and bloated with features I didn’t need. All I really wanted was a **simple notepad** to write things _down—fast_.

Most of the time, I took quick notes using Markdown in **VSCode** before eventually copying them into Notion. Markdown was faster to type, entirely keyboard-driven, and easy to read with the right extensions. VSCode made it simple and efficient.

That’s why I started building **DumbNote**:

- Clean, VSCode-style Markdown rendering
- Easy sharing/publishing via GitHub Gists (a feature inspired by Notion)
- All notes are saved as plain `.md` files on my local machine—no lock-in (_menu: File -> Goto Note Folder_)
- Markdown is becoming a universal writing format, especially with AI tools
- I can back up everything to my NAS, external drive, or Google Drive—**no strings attached**
