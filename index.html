        <div class="why-content">
          <p>
            I've been a fan of note-taking with <b>Notion</b> since the day it launched—I even paid for the subscription. But one day, I decided to cut down on my recurring expenses, and Notion was one of the first to go. <b></b>That's when I realized: getting out wasn't easy.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried <b>Obsidian</b>. It looked great at first, but over time I found it too distracting and bloated with features I didn't need. <b>All I really wanted was a simple notepad to write things down—fast.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the time, I took quick notes using Markdown in VSCode before eventually copying them into Notion. <b>Markdown was faster to type, entirely keyboard-driven, and easy to read with the right extensions</b>. VSCode made it simple and efficient.
          </p>
          <p><strong>That's why I started building DumbNote:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean, VSCode-style Markdown rendering</li>
            <li>Easy sharing/publishing via GitHub Gists (a feature inspired by Notion)</li>
            <li>All notes are saved as plain .md files on my local machine—no lock-in (menu: File → Goto Note Folder)</li>
            <li>Markdown is becoming a universal writing format, especially with AI tools</li>
            <li>I can back up everything to my NAS, external drive, or Google Drive—no strings attached</li>
