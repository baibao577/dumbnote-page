# Typewriter Mode

Experience distraction-free writing with Typewriter Mode - a feature that keeps your cursor centered on screen while you type, letting you focus on your current line without constantly looking up and down.

## What is Typewriter Mode?

Typewriter Mode automatically scrolls your document to keep the cursor at a fixed position on your screen. As you type or navigate, the text moves around your cursor instead of your cursor moving to the edge of the screen.

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced eye strain** - Your eyes stay focused on one spot
- **Better posture** - No need to look down at the bottom of the screen
- **Improved focus** - Current line stays in your natural viewing area
- **Smoother writing** - Less visual jumping around

## Enabling Typewriter Mode

### Quick Toggle
Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+T` to instantly toggle Typewriter Mode on or off.

### Menu Toggle
Go to **Edit → Typewriter Mode → Toggle Typewriter Mode**

When enabled:
- A checkmark appears in the menu
- Your cursor position smoothly animates to center
- The mode stays active until you toggle it off

## Cursor Position Options

Choose where on your screen the cursor stays locked. DumbNote offers 7 preset positions:

### Available Positions

| Position | Where on Screen | Best For |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **20%** | Upper area | Reading while writing |
| **30%** | Upper-middle | Note-taking from sources |
| **40%** | Just above center | Comfortable typing |
| **50%** | Exact center (default) | Balanced view |
| **60%** | Just below center | Natural eye level |
| **70%** | Lower-middle | Standing desk users |
| **80%** | Lower area | When referencing above |

### Changing Position

1. Enable Typewriter Mode first
2. Go to **Edit → Typewriter Mode**
3. Select your preferred position (20% through 80%)
4. The cursor immediately moves to the new position

**Tip**: Experiment to find your sweet spot. Most users prefer 40-60%.

## How It Works

### While Typing
- Each new line keeps the cursor at your chosen position
- Text flows smoothly upward as you type
- No jarring jumps or repositioning

### While Navigating
- Arrow keys maintain the centered position
- Page Up/Down respects your position preference  
- Mouse clicks still work normally
- Smart detection prevents jittery movement during rapid navigation

### Smart Scrolling
DumbNote uses intelligent scrolling that:
- Animates smoothly (no instant jumps)
- Speeds up for rapid typing
- Slows down for careful navigation
- Pauses during continuous arrow key movement

## Why "Typewriter"?

The name comes from traditional typewriters where the paper moves while the typing position stays fixed. This digital version gives you that same focused writing experience without the clacking keys and ribbon changes!
