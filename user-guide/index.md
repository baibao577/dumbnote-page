## Philosophy

DumbNote follows a simple philosophy: be powerful without being complicated. We believe that a note-taking app should:

1. **Start fast** - Your thoughts shouldn't wait for the app to load
2. **Stay out of the way** - The interface should be invisible when you're writing
3. **Work offline** - Your notes are yours, no internet required
4. **Respect your data** - Local storage, optional sync, full export
